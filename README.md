- 👋 Hi, I’m @BigToughFrogMan
- 👀 I’m interested in crypto, gaming, photography, hiking, metal music and general shenanigans
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all about fullstack coding through nucamp.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will push my skills. So far I have done an introduction course to HTML, Javascript, CSS and a fundamentals course on Python along with a intro to SQL with Python and am currently learning about deploying via AWS, Azure etc... before taking the fullstack deep dive course starting in July.
